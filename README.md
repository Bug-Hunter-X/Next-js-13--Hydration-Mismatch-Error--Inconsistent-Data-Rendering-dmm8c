# Next.js 13+ Hydration Mismatch Error
This repository demonstrates a common hydration mismatch error encountered in Next.js 13+ applications. The error arises from discrepancies between the data rendered on the server and the data rendered on the client.

## Problem
The `about.js` file renders data directly within the component.  In Next.js 13+, this can lead to a hydration mismatch if the client-side data differs from the server-side data.  This often happens when data is fetched or processed differently between the server and client.

## Solution
To fix this issue, ensure data fetching and processing is consistent between the server and the client.  A common approach is using `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` to fetch data on the server and pass it to the component as props.  This allows the server and client to use the same data for rendering.
